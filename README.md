# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
 Goal of this repository is to create a tidy dataset utilizing the run_analysis.R script
 
 Run analysis steps are: 
 * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#### Included in this repository:
* run_analysis.R
* CodeBook.md
